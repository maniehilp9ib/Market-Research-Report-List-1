<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PET Bottle Recycling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical</li><li>Mechanical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PET bottle recycling market is divided into two main types: chemical and mechanical recycling. Mechanical recycling involves shredding and washing PET bottles to produce recycled pellets, which can be remolded into new products. This method is cost-effective but may degrade the material quality over time. In contrast, chemical recycling breaks down PET into its monomers, allowing for the production of high-quality virgin-like plastic. This process is more complex and energy-intensive but offers the potential for a circular economy in PET use.</p></p>
